<h1>Tilt Escape</h1>
<p>Like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labyrinth_(marble_game)">Marble Labyrinth</a>
,but players must tilt the stage to navigate while avoiding security guards.</p>

<p>This game is played on an level like the one drawn above. Levels will contain:
	a player, a goal, walls, and one or more security guards. The player will use
	the arrow keys to tilt the level, causing the player to roll in the direction
	of the tilt. If the player reaches the goal, then a they are dropped into a
	new level. However if they get caught inside the guard's vision, then they
	must resart the level from the beginning.
</p>

<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<p><strong>Start:</strong> at the start of the level, the player is placed at a
predetermined start position. Guards are also placed at predetermined start
positions.</p>

<p><strong>Movement:</strong> The player moves by tilting the level using the arrow
keys. The level can tilt both left, right, up and down. Below, only a rightward tilt
is drawn.</p>

</div>

<p><strong>Guards:</strong> Guards move in preset patterns around the level. They are
unaffected by changes in level tilt. The cone in front of them represents their field
of view. If the player intersects with this code, then they will have to restart from
the level's starting point</p>

<p><strong>Finish:</strong> When the player reaches the goal door, the level is complete
and they will be placed on the next level.</p>
